## OPENGL Pong Project

Hello! I wanted to get some experience with using a third party library in C++. 
This project is to create a pong game in C++ using the OpenGL library.

All the source code is included here, as well as visual studio settings for easy importability and building
To run the game, just run Pong.exe included at the root of the project!

This application was developed and compiled on a Windows machine on an intel processor.

Planned features include multiplayer support and viewing replays.
