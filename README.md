## OPENGL Pong Project

Hello! I wanted to get some experience with using third party libraries in C++. 
This project is to create a pong game in C++ using the OpenGL library, which means dealing directly with the graphics pipeline 
and matrix transformations!

In particular, I use the following libraries:
* GLFW openGL window manager
* glad openGL function wrapper
* glm math library
* stb_image for image loading
* dear imgui for user interface options


All the source code is included here, as well as visual studio settings for easy importability and building
To run the game, just run Pong.exe included at the root of the project!

This application was developed and compiled on a Windows machine on an intel processor.

The AI is currently simple, but effective and everything for single player is working!

Planned features include multiplayer support and viewing replays.
